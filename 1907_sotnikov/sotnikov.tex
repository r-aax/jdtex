\begin{abstract}
Here are proposed robustness characteristics of the algorithm of identification of the type of the dynamic object (DO) and the law of probability distribution of identification sufficient statistics, formed by the algorithm under prior uncertainty.
The law is applied for verification and validation of the algorithm.
Wavelet fractal correlation algorithm (WFCA) implements vectorial criterion of ratio of likelihood functions of simple alternative hypotheses - types of DOs, this criterion being invariant to specific features of DO motion trajectories.
The likelihood functions are reconstructed by simulation according to sufficiently representative complexes of implementations of fractal dimensions, energies, wavelet spectra and maximum eigenvalues of biased correlation matrices as functional of the measured coordinates of spatial attitude of various types of real DOs located by the optoelectron device (OED).
The simulation proved  robustness and high efficiency of the algorithm of identification of the type of DOs.
